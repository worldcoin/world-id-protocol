# Circom Circuit Audit — Least Authority

The circuits in the `/circom` subfolder were extracted from [the circom directory in oprf-service](https://github.com/TaceoLabs/oprf-service/tree/c66a146ce5b1e87207e99160e8855ab88fa08bd8/circom),
which was audited by Least Authority in Jan 2026. The accompanying audit report can be found in this directory. The circuits where copied to this repository in commit [64a3d385b4e452e7ccc538c4155328a649e0a154](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-protocol/commit/64a3d385b4e452e7ccc538c4155328a649e0a154), verifying the file hashes against the source files.
