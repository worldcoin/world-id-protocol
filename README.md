# World ID 4.0 Trusted Setup Artifacts

This orphan branch contains the full trusted setup ceremony artifacts, verification transcripts,
video documentation, and deprecated circuit files.

These files are kept separate from the main branch to reduce repository size. Only the essential
proving keys (`*.arks.zkey`) and witness graph files (`*Graph.bin`) are kept on the main branch.

## Contents

- `circom/artifacts/` — Full ceremony outputs per circuit (zkeys, r1cs, wasm, verifier contracts, vkeys, transcripts)
- `circom/artifacts/deprecated/` — Previous generation artifacts
- `docs/world-id-4-trusted-setup/` — Trusted setup documentation, video, and manim source
